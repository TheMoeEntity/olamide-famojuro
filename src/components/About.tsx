        Famojuro Olamide is a multidisciplinary 3D artist with a strong
        foundation in both traditional and digital art. With a passion for
        storytelling and visual design, he has contributed to a variety of
        creative projects spanning games, animation, collectibles, and
        character-driven short films. <br />
        He began his journey as a 2D illustrator before transitioning into 3D
        character art, where he now specializes in modeling, sculpting,
        texturing, and shading. Known for his stylized yet grounded approach,
        Henry has collaborated with indie studios and creative teams to develop
        memorable characters and assets for both cinematic and interactive
        experiences. <br />
        In addition to production work, Olamide has mentored aspiring artists,
        sharing his knowledge of anatomy, design, and digital sculpting. He
        continues to expand his artistic reachâ€”pursuing personal projects,
        exhibiting his work online, and exploring new ways to blend traditional
        influence with modern pipelines. <br /> Henry is currently focused on
        creating emotionally-driven character art that bridges stylization and
        realism, while building a body of work that reflects his love for form,
        storytelling, and visual impact
